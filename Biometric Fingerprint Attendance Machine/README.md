The place at I currently work does not have a punching machine, as a result, we have to write our working hours on the sheet. Sometimes, I did forget to include my hours in the hour sheet and as a result, when my employer makes the paycheck, I need to count my hours by checking the hours of the person who worked before the person who worked after me and me. And in a few cases, I did get less salary for hours or 2. For an international student, 20-30$ is a week's grocery. So that is why I decided to make an application that does count hours and all that stuff for me
